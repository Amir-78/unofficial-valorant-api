# Before using this API
Please make sure that the User has giving his consent to using his data. Analytic services where the user haven't giving his consent are not supportet and will be banned if found out

# Authentication and Rate Limits
All rate limits are the same for every endpoint, so in general you have **250 Requests every 2.5 Minutes**. Your rate limit is based on your IP so you don't need an API Key for authentication.
If you exceed rate limit you will get following JSON with 429 Status Code:
```json
{
    "status": 429,
    "message": "You reached your Rate Limit, please try again later"
}
```
**Important:**
The API will move in the future to a key based system, no application and therefore no waittime is required. When this change will go live is unknown yet, it's expected to happen in summer 2022. This change will happen because of large botting attacks which impacts all other developers.

*Edit: Some further information on this: You are now able to generate a key on the linked discord above, since it is easier for me to implement such a system over a discord bot instead of creating a website for it. It is also easier to contact the developers if something is wrong, since i will connect the API key to the Discord Account ID.*
*You will also have to enter some details about your app, for example the usecase. I will ask you for this so i can make sure the API is not used in a bad way and (hopefully) the user knows that his data is used. 

There are also some Rate Limit Adjustments:
- No Key: 
   - 30req/min (2 uncached accounts/hour)
   - Suitable for: Twitch Bots | Educational purposes (How do i code etc)
- Basic Key:
    - 90req/min (unlimited uncached accounts/hour if available)
    - Suitable for: Private Discord Bots (Servers) | Websites
- Production Key:
    - Rate Limit you requested
    - Suitable for: Production Discord Bots | Websites
    - PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOU ALSO REQUEST AN OFFICIAL VALORANT API KEY AT RIOT TO GET RSO IF YOU HAVE A STATS FEATURE FOR EXAMPLE
